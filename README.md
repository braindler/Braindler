# RoboGPT: Internet-Enabled AI for Real-World Tasks, Goal Achievement, and Human Communication

RoboGPT, when given a goal in natural language, attempts to achieve it by decomposing it into sub-tasks and using the internet and other tools while applying recursion, depth-first search, and breadth-first search. Within the recursion process, separate roles can be created, resulting in a team of specialized virtual professionals working together. RoboGPT can utilize not only OpenAI's GPT-4 or GPT-3.5 API but also TrueGPT, which is trained to produce output in RoboScript format, enabling interactive capabilities beyond conventional text responses.


RoboGPT is the next-generation upgrade to the GPT series, harnessing the power of the internet for improved interactions, problem-solving, and communication with people. This user-friendly AI can access websites, gather information, complete tasks, and seamlessly engage with users in a chat interface.
Active Internet Engagement capabilities go beyond traditional chat interfaces by enabling proactive interaction with online resources and services. For instance, RoboGPT can autonomously send a message to a person or group, fill out a web form, or conduct API interactions to streamline tasks and enhance the user experience.
Experience the future of AI with RoboGPT, designed to help users efficiently tackle tasks, achieve their goals, and enhance human communication through active online engagement.
