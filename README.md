# Braindler: Internet-Enabled AI for Real-World Tasks, Goal Achievement, and Human Communication

![Braindler](/assets/braindler.png)
<br/>Braindler, when given a goal in natural language, attempts to achieve it by decomposing it into sub-tasks and using the internet and other tools while applying recursion, depth-first search, and breadth-first search. Within the recursion process, separate roles can be created, resulting in a team of specialized virtual professionals working together. Braindler can utilize not only OpenAI's GPT-4 or GPT-3.5 API but also TrueGPT, which is trained to produce output in RoboScript format, enabling interactive capabilities beyond conventional text responses.


Braindler is the next-generation upgrade to the GPT series, harnessing the power of the internet for improved interactions, problem-solving, and communication with people. This user-friendly AI can access websites, gather information, complete tasks, and seamlessly engage with users in a chat interface.
Active Internet Engagement capabilities go beyond traditional chat interfaces by enabling proactive interaction with online resources and services. For instance, Braindler can autonomously send a message to a person or group, fill out a web form, or conduct API interactions to streamline tasks and enhance the user experience.
