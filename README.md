# RoboGPT: Internet-Enabled AI for Real-World Tasks, Goal Achievement, and Human Communication

RoboGPT, when given a goal in natural language, attempts to achieve it by decomposing it into sub-tasks and using the internet and other tools while applying recursion, depth-first search, and breadth-first search. Within the recursion process, separate roles can be created, resulting in a team of specialized virtual professionals working together. RoboGPT can utilize not only OpenAI's GPT-4 or GPT-3.5 API but also TrueGPT, which is trained to produce output in RoboScript format, enabling interactive capabilities beyond conventional text responses.


RoboGPT is the next-generation upgrade to the GPT series, harnessing the power of the internet for improved interactions, problem-solving, and communication with people. This user-friendly AI can access websites, gather information, complete tasks, and seamlessly engage with users in a chat interface.
Active Internet Engagement capabilities go beyond traditional chat interfaces by enabling proactive interaction with online resources and services. For instance, RoboGPT can autonomously send a message to a person or group, fill out a web form, or conduct API interactions to streamline tasks and enhance the user experience.
Experience the future of AI with RoboGPT, designed to help users efficiently tackle tasks, achieve their goals, and enhance human communication through active online engagement.

## RoboGPT vs ChatGPT

RoboGPT builds upon the foundations of ChatGPT while offering several key enhancements:
* Passive Information Gathering: RoboGPT effectively extracts relevant information from websites and databases, providing users with the most up-to-date and accurate data for their needs, without requiring manual initiation or step-by-step instructions.
* Active Internet Engagement: RoboGPT proactively interacts with online resources and services, enabling seamless coordination with individuals and organizations to simplify tasks and enhance user experience. For instance, RoboGPT can autonomously order a pizza from a local pizzeria or arrange a taxi pickup without requiring the user to manually initiate contact.
* Enhanced Problem Solving: By leveraging its internet connectivity, RoboGPT can perform more complex tasks and provide more accurate information to users, leading to better problem-solving capabilities.
* Goal Achievement: RoboGPT is designed to help users achieve their goals by not only providing relevant information but also by actively assisting in task execution.
These differences make RoboGPT a more versatile and powerful AI assistant compared to ChatGPT, enhancing the user experience and expanding the range of tasks it can help users accomplish.
